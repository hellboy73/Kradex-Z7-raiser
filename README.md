# Kradex-Z7-raiser
Commodore 64/128 cartridge enclosure mod. Allows to use Kradex Z7 case with socketed chips.

Kradex is a polish electronic enclosure manufacturer known in the retro computing world for its "Z7" enclosure. It is a basic, but durable and affordable case compatible with Commodore 64/128 cartridge port. It is commonly used for homebrew cartridges for decades, not only in Poland. The major downside of Z7 is its low profile and due to this feature it will not fit boards with socketed chips. 

Below project is enabling Kradex Z7 enclosure for socketed chips with a help of a 3d printed frame that raises the top part of the cartridge enclosure by exactly 3mm.
Round element can be easily dismounted and optionally used to prolong the screw guide in the middle. 
TIP: You also need to get a slightly longer screw from local hardware store to close the cartridge tightly.
